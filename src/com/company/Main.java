Create a new InteliJ project called ( JavaAlgorithms810 ) Complete the following algorithms where each algorithm is store in a new class and the solution is in a method called "run"



        Spend the first 60 minutes of class working on the first two on your own. Then work on the last two as a group.


        Create the classes with the names above the links




        ArrayOfMultiples

        PerfectSquarePatch

        https://edabit.com/challenge/7Tb7qMDQHtz3xpydd



        Reverse the String (with a catch)

        (for this one create a cipher and decipher method)



        To Submit:
        Either submit a link to a GitHub page hosting your solutions OR upload the three classes you created. (Having them on GitHub is better)
